1. Define the problem:
   - What does the program need to do? (In this case, simulate a voting machine)
   - What are the key features? (Recording votes, checking if voting is open, displaying results)

2. Identify the main components:
   - VotingMachine class
   - Vote counting mechanism
   - Voting state (open/closed)
   - User interface for voting

3. Plan the class structure:
   - Attributes: What data does the class need to store?
     (candidateA votes, candidateB votes, voting state)
   - Methods: What actions can the class perform?
     (constructor, vote, run voting process)

4. Design the user interaction:
   - How will users input their votes?
   - How will the program respond to inputs?
   - How will the program end and display results?

5. Implement the class:
   - Start with a basic structure and build up
   - Implement one method at a time
   - Test each method as you go

6. Refine and optimize:
   - Look for ways to improve the code
   - Consider edge cases and error handling

Let's break down the implementation process:

1. Start with the class declaration and attributes:
   ```java
   public class VotingMachine {
       private int candidateA;
       private int candidateB;
       private boolean isVotingOpen;
   }
   ```

2. Implement the constructor:
   ```java
   public VotingMachine() {
       candidateA = 0;
       candidateB = 0;
       isVotingOpen = true;
   }
   ```

3. Implement the vote method:
   - Consider the voting state
   - Use if/else statements to handle different candidates
   ```java
   public void vote(String candidate) {
       if (isVotingOpen) {
           if (candidate.equalsIgnoreCase("A")) {
               candidateA++;
               System.out.println("Vote for Candidate A recorded.");
           } else if (candidate.equalsIgnoreCase("B")) {
               candidateB++;
               System.out.println("Vote for Candidate B recorded.");
           } else {
               System.out.println("Invalid candidate. Please vote for A or B.");
           }
       } else {
           System.out.println("Voting is closed.");
       }
   }
   ```

4. Implement the runVoting method:
   - Set up a loop for continuous voting
   - Use a Scanner for user input
   - Implement a way to end voting
   - Display results at the end
   ```java
   public void runVoting() {
       java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
       
       while (isVotingOpen) {
           System.out.println("Enter 'A' to vote for Candidate A, 'B' for Candidate B, or 'Q' to quit:");
           String input = scanner.nextLine();
           
           if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("Q")) {
               isVotingOpen = false;
           } else {
               vote(input);
           }
       }
       
       System.out.println("Voting is closed. Final results:");
       System.out.println("Candidate A: " + candidateA + " votes");
       System.out.println("Candidate B: " + candidateB + " votes");
       
       scanner.close();
   }
   ```

5. Test the program:
   - Create a main method to run the VotingMachine
   - Try different scenarios (voting for A, B, invalid candidates, quitting)

6. Refine as needed:
   - Consider adding error handling
   - Think about scalability (e.g., how would you add more candidates?)
